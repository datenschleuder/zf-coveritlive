 * ZF-CoveritLive
 * 
 * This method allows you to post content directly into your live event from a custom application. 
 * Once set up you will be able to auto-publish content (including text and multimedia) from external 
 * sources such as 3rd party image or content management systems. Set it up once and let the API 
 * do all the work during your event. This allows CoveritLive to be integrated with just about 
 * any application that can connect to the web.
